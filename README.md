# node_rest_api_practice

Coded by Kerick Howlett

This was nothing more than an exercise I completed as a part of a LinkedIn Learning Course, *Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express* by Emmanuel Henri.

While going through the course, I modified the code as I went along: streamlined it in certain areas to reduce the number of repeated blocks of code that I could without creating an extensive design pattern.

Originally, the course used Babel 6, but I updated it to Babel 7, so that I could patch up the *Regular Expression Denial-of-Service* (low severity) vulnerability, and so that I could keep up-to-date with the latest versions out there. Normally, I'm used to these things not having many changes on the surface, but Babel had quite a few with the Body-parser, so be weary of that if you try it yourself.
